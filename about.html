          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We are Rev Mechanics, a dynamic team of students from VIT Vellore
            with a passion for engineering and innovation in the field of
            motorsports. Our journey began with the aim of applying engineering
            fundamentals to create a world-class MotoGP-style racing bike and
            participating in prestigious international competitions such as
            MotoStudent Spain. We believe that true learning happens beyond the
            classroom, and through collaboration, creativity, and relentless
            hard work, we strive to build revolutionary vehicles that showcase
            our technical prowess and dedication.

            <h4>Super EV for Racing Competitions (yet to be completed)</h4>
            <p>
              Description: This is our latest project aimed at creating a Super
              EV for competitive racing. We have successfully developed the
              battery pack and motor so far, focusing on performance,
              efficiency, and sustainability. This vehicle is being designed to
              push the boundaries of electric vehicle racing.

            <h4>Generative Design Approach</h4>
            <p>
              One of our standout innovations is the use of generative design
              for critical motorcycle components like the swingarm and chassis.
              By applying forces in simulations and iterating designs, we've
              created components that are both lightweight and strong, pushing
              the boundaries of what is possible in terms of aesthetics and
              performance (GENERATIVE MANUFACTURING).

          <div class="idea">
            <h4>Collaboration with Autodesk</h4>
            <p>
              Our collaboration with Autodesk has allowed us to utilize advanced
              tools in Fusion 360, enabling us to perform sophisticated design
              simulations and testing. The cloud-based collaboration has
              streamlined our teamwork, helping us iterate designs faster and
              more efficiently.
